# Set Up UniFi Protect MCP Server

Walk the user through configuring their UniFi Protect NVR connection. Ask one question at a time and wait for the answer before continuing.

## Interaction Rules

Use the client target that matches the current agent runtime:
- Claude Code: `claude`
- Codex: `codex`
- OpenClaw: `openclaw`

If the runtime is unclear, ask which client to configure. For questions, use the platform's blocking question tool when available (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex). If no blocking question tool is available, ask in chat with numbered options and wait for the user's reply.

On macOS and Linux, resolve setup scripts relative to this skill file:
- `../../scripts/check-prereqs.sh`
- `../../scripts/set-env.sh`

When the host exposes a plugin-root variable such as `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, using `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/...` is also valid. Do not assume the current shell directory is the plugin root.

On Windows with Claude Code, use `../../scripts/set-env.ps1` for the final Claude settings write. On Windows with Codex, prefer the native PowerShell prereq script and call `codex mcp add` directly with the same env variables if Bash is unavailable. On Windows with OpenClaw, call `openclaw mcp set` directly with a JSON object containing `command`, `args`, and `env` if Bash is unavailable. Do not run the Bash prereq script on Windows unless the user explicitly asks to use a Bash environment.

## Step 0: Check Prerequisites

Before asking for credentials, run the prereq checker for the current OS.

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
bash <path-to-plugin>/scripts/check-prereqs.sh --target <claude|codex|openclaw> "unifi-protect"
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-plugin>/scripts/check-prereqs.ps1 -Target <claude|codex|openclaw> -PluginName "unifi-protect"
```

If the script exits non-zero, stop and report the error. Do not proceed to credentials.

## Step 1: Controller Host

Ask: "What is your UniFi controller's IP address or hostname?" Example: `192.168.1.1`.

If another UniFi MCP server is already configured, ask whether Protect is on the same controller. For Claude, existing values may be in `.claude/settings.local.json`. For Codex, existing values may be visible through `codex mcp list` and `codex mcp get <server>`. For OpenClaw, existing values may be visible through `openclaw mcp list` and `openclaw mcp show <server>`.

## Step 2: Credentials

If the user already configured shared `UNIFI_*` credentials for another UniFi server, mention they can reuse those credentials. Only set `UNIFI_PROTECT_*` values when Protect credentials differ.

Ask for:
1. Username, using a local admin account, not a Ubiquiti SSO account
2. Password

Username and password are required.

If the user would rather not store the password in the client's settings (where every process the client spawns inherits it), offer the indirect form instead: `UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD_FILE=<path>` for a file holding the password (Docker and systemd secrets convention). Set exactly one of the two password variables; the server refuses to start if both are set. On the Claude target `set-env.sh` only adds keys, so if a plain `UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD` was saved earlier, remove it from `.claude/settings.local.json` before switching; the Codex and OpenClaw targets replace the whole server entry.

> **AI-powered alarms need SuperAdmin.** The alarm-rule tools (`protect_alarm_list_rules` / `protect_alarm_get_rule`) surface AI-powered alarms from the UniFi-OS Alarm Manager only when the account is **SuperAdmin**; otherwise they return the classic automations view (with a `_meta` notice that AI alarms need SuperAdmin). A standard local admin runs every Protect tool fine. Mention SuperAdmin only if the user asks about AI alarms; don't require it for normal setup. On a combined UDM console, SuperAdmin also grants Network/UniFi-OS control — call that out so the user can decide.

### Optional API Key

After collecting username and password, explain that a UniFi Protect API key enables selected capabilities implemented through the Protect Integration API, including sensor settings, per-camera chime ring settings, and viewer liveview assignment. Ask whether to configure an API key too.

If yes, ask for the API key and include `UNIFI_PROTECT_API_KEY`. If no, skip it.

## Step 3: Permission Configuration

Ask whether to enable write permissions. By default, Protect mutations are disabled for camera settings, recording control, PTZ, and reboots.

Options:
- Read-only for now
- Enable camera management
- Enable all device management
- Custom categories

Collect any selected policy variables. Use the existing `UNIFI_POLICY_PROTECT_<CATEGORY>_<ACTION>=true` format.

## Step 4: Write Configuration

On macOS/Linux, run the target-aware setup script with only values the user provided or selected:

```bash
bash <path-to-plugin>/scripts/set-env.sh --target <claude|codex|openclaw> \
  UNIFI_PROTECT_HOST=<host> \
  UNIFI_PROTECT_USERNAME=<username> \
  UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD=<password>
```

Add optional values and policy variables to the same command, for example:

```bash
bash <path-to-plugin>/scripts/set-env.sh --target <claude|codex|openclaw> \
  UNIFI_PROTECT_HOST=<host> \
  UNIFI_PROTECT_USERNAME=<username> \
  UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD=<password> \
  UNIFI_PROTECT_API_KEY=<api-key> \
  UNIFI_POLICY_PROTECT_CAMERAS_UPDATE=true
```

The script handles the client-specific write:
- Claude target: merges env vars into `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Codex target: replaces the `unifi-protect` MCP server via `codex mcp add --env ... -- uvx ...`
- OpenClaw target: replaces the `unifi-protect` MCP server via `openclaw mcp set ...`

## Step 5: Final Message

For Claude Code, tell the user:

"Configuration saved to `.claude/settings.local.json`. Restart Claude Code or run `/reload-plugins`, then confirm the plugin is enabled with `/plugin`."

For Codex, tell the user:

"Codex MCP server `unifi-protect` configured. Restart Codex so the updated MCP server is loaded."

For OpenClaw, tell the user:

"OpenClaw MCP server `unifi-protect` configured. Restart the OpenClaw Gateway so the updated MCP server is loaded."
