# Support

UniFi MCP is maintained as an open source project. Support is best effort and
community-driven.

## Where to Get Help

Use the channel that matches what you need:

| Need | Where to go |
|------|-------------|
| Setup help, configuration questions, or troubleshooting | [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/discussions) |
| Reproducible MCP bugs | Generate and review a [sanitized support bundle](docs/support-bundles.md), then [open a bug report](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/issues/new/choose) |
| Feature requests or design discussion | [Open a feature request](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/issues/new/choose) or start a discussion |
| Security vulnerabilities | [Report privately through GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/security/advisories) |

Please do not post UniFi credentials, API keys, tokens, controller addresses, or
other private deployment details in public issues or discussions.

## Before Asking

Please check these resources first:

- [README.md](README.md) for installation and quick-start guidance
- [Support bundle guide](docs/support-bundles.md) for privacy-bounded Network, Protect, and Access troubleshooting evidence
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development workflow and test commands
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the security model and vulnerability reporting
- Existing [issues](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/issues) and
  [discussions](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/discussions)

When asking for help, include the component you are using, package version or git
SHA, install method, MCP client, operating system, and a reviewed support bundle
when the server can start. Ordinary diagnostic logs are not automatically safe to
post publicly; provide manually sanitized logs only when a maintainer asks for them.

## Scope

This project maintains the UniFi MCP servers, shared packages, relay sidecar,
Cloudflare Worker gateway, API server, and plugin packaging in this repository.

Problems in UniFi controller firmware or upstream client libraries should be
reported to their maintainers. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the current
in-scope and out-of-scope security boundaries.
